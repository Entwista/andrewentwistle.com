        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm trying make computers into better tools at <a href="https://edulilo.com">Edulilo</a>.</p>
        <p>I've worked as a mathematics tutor, PwC tax consultant, and software engineer. I don't consider my identity as being linked to a profession as nearly as much as it is linked to independence.</p>
        <p>I'm also a keen advocate of Stoic philosophy, I consider most of my life through the lens of <i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <i>Meditations</i>, and  <i>Discourses</i></p>
